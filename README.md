# [W3 Resource Python Basics 1](https://github.com/Darrenrodricks/w3resourceBasicPython1/tree/main/w3schoolPractice)

* After finishing a couple courses on Python, I wanted to apply my basic knowledge and practice my skills. I found W3 as a great tool for this, within this repo there are around 80 exercises that I have completed dealing with various concepts such as Flow control, String concatenation, List Comprehension, Dictionaries, and other elemets that deal with the basics. My biggest struggle while working on these activities is File I/O concepts. I think that this repo helped me a lot, getting good practice as well as learning to think computationally on my own without a class or teacher to help me with my work.
